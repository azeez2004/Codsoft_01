IMDb Movies Rating Prediction
This project aims to predict movie ratings using a linear regression model based on various categorical features such as genre, director, and actors. The dataset, IMDb Movies India.csv, is loaded and preprocessed by encoding categorical columns (Genre, Director, Actor 1, Actor 2) into numerical values using LabelEncoder. After handling missing values, the data is split into training and test sets, and a linear regression model is trained to predict movie ratings. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and predictions for new movie data are made. For accurate predictions, ensure to define new_movie with appropriate feature values before running the model. Make sure to have pandas and scikit-learn installed in your environment.
